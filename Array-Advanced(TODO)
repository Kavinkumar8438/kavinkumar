1.find next lexicographically greater permutation
Problem Statement: Given an array Arr[] of integers, rearrange the numbers of the given array into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange to the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
Input format:
Arr[] = {3,2,1}
Output format: 
Arr[] = {1,2,3}
Explanation: 
As we see all permutations of 1 2 3 is
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2 
3 2 1
we find {3,2,1} at the last position.
So, we have to return the topmost permutation.
2.Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which
has the largest sum and returns its sum and prints the subarray.
Input:
 arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] 
Output:
6
Explanation:
 [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 

3.Rearrange Array Elements by Sign
Problem Statement:
There’s an array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ with an equal number of positive and negative elements. Without altering the relative order of positive and negative elements, you must return an array of alternately positive and negative values.
Note: Start the array with positive elements.
Input:
A[] = {1,2,-4,-5}, N = 4
Output:
1 -4 2 -5

4.Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array
Problem Statement: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.
Input:
 [100, 200, 1, 3, 2, 4]
Output:
 4
Explanation:
 The longest consecutive subsequence is 1, 2, 3, and 4.

5.(NOTE 2 SUM Based)
Three sum(Triplet) that add up to a zero
Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique triplets that add up to give a sum of zero. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique triplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c]] such that i!=j, j!=k, k!=i, and their sum is equal to zero.
Input:
 nums=[-1,0,1,0]
Output:
 Output: [[-1,0,1],[-1,1,0]]
Explanation:
 Out of all possible unique triplets possible, [-1,0,1] and [-1,1,0] satisfy the condition of summing up to zero with i!=j!=k
